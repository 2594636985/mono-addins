	* Mono.Addins/Addin.cs: Added support for global add-in names.
	* Mono.Addins/ExtensionContext.cs: Make sure extensions of recently
	  installed add-ins are properly loaded. Don't call OnAddinLoaded on
	  nodes until all nodes of the extension point have been loaded,
	  since OnAddinLoaded implementations may try to access to children
	  which have not yet been loaded.
	* Mono.Addins/ExtensionNode.cs: Added some null checks.
	* Mono.Addins/ExtensionTree.cs: Fixed order when the insertafer
	  attribute is specified.
	* Mono.Addins/TreeNode.cs: Added method for getting an extension point
	  from a path.
	* Mono.Addins/AddinRegistry.cs: Added new env var for specifying the
	  global add-in registry.
	* Mono.Addins.Database/AddinScanFolderInfo.cs: Only include add-in
	  files in the list of missing files.
	* Mono.Addins.Database/AddinDatabase.cs: Properly remove add-in
	  manifests from add-in folders that have been deleted.
	* Mono.Addins.Database/AddinScanner.cs: Moved code that removes
	  manifests from deleted add-ins to a new method, which is called
	  from AddinDatabase as well.

	* Mono.Addins.mdp: Generate a winexe, to avoid showing a console in
	  windows.
	* Mono.Addins/Addin.cs: Null check.
	* Mono.Addins/AddinSessionService.cs, Mono.Addins/AddinManager.cs,
	  Mono.Addins.Database/AddinScanner.cs: Use Assembly.CodeBase, since
	  Assembly.Location will return the wrong value when the assembly is
	  loaded using shadow copy.
	* Mono.Addins/AddinRegistry.cs, Mono.Addins.Database/SetupProcess.cs:
	  Windows portability fixes.
	* Mono.Addins.Description/ExtensionNodeSet.cs: Workaround for mono bug.
	* Mono.Addins.Database/Util.cs, Mono.Addins.Database/FileDatabase.cs:
	  Use a custom method for getting a string hash, to make sure we get
	  consistent results.

	* Mono.Addins.mdp: Updated.
	* Mono.Addins/AddinRegistry.cs: Create the add-ins folder for host
	  references when it doesn't exist.
