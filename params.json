This framework has been designed to be useful for a wide range of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs, to complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Mono.Addins are:\r\n\r\n* Supports descriptions of add-ins using custom attributes (for simple and common extensions) or using XML manifests (for more complex extensibility needs).\r\n* Supports extension metadata and data-only extensions.\r\n* Support for add-in hierarchies, where add-ins may depend on other add-ins.\r\n* Lazy loading of add-ins.\r\n* Dynamic activation / deactivation of add-ins at run time.\r\n* Allows sharing add-in registries between applications, and defining arbitrary add-in locations.\r\n* Allows implementing extensible libraries.\r\n* Supports add-in localization.\r\n* Provides an API for accessing to add-in descriptions, which will allow building development and documentation tools for handling add-ins.\r\n* In addition to the basic add-in engine, it provides a Setup library to be used by applications which want to offer basic add-in management features to users, such as enabling/disabling add-ins, or installing add-ins from on-line repositories.\r\n\r\nTo know more about Mono.Addins, go to the Documentation page.\r\n\r\nYou'll find the latest stable release in the Releases page.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
